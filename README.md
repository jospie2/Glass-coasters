# Glass-coasters
This is a Glass coaster which can light up your glass with ws2812b Led´s. It has a pcb for the led´s.
I made a pcb for the LEDS you can order it with the gerber files I have uploadet.
Then you will need ws2812b LEDS you can order them really cheap you will need 11 LEDs per lamp for example this https://www.amazon.de/LED-Pixel-Diode-WS2812B-integriertem-Driver-St%C3%BCck-RGB/dp/B00DUBLU6E/ .
You also will need an wemos d1 mini https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01N9RXGHY/ref=twister_B07ZQP9FSX?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
and a battery pack https://www.amazon.de/KEESIN-Batteriehalter-Aufbewahrungsbox-Befestigung-Kabelbinder/dp/B077P18KHB/
You also will need some other things to build it
3d printer
White filament
soldering iron
solder or 
smd reflow iron and paste
3xaaa battery
the arduino ide installed and the wemos d1 mini extencion url loaded.
You can see 2 different arduino files one is for normal efects and the other is for integrating the projetc in a api.
But you can also use it with other control software for example WLED for ws2812b leds. 
So lets have fun!
In the image you can see a little cable- This is only there because the was an error on the pcb but I fixed it in the new version you won't need this cable!
I will upload the 3d file on thingiverse soon!
